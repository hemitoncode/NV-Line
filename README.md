  <h1>Next Voters Line</h1>
  <p><strong>Dead simple bulk email sending for civic engagement and voter outreach.</strong></p>
</div>

## Why NV Line?

Most email tools are either:
- Too complex (requiring extensive configuration)
- Too expensive (enterprise pricing for basic sending)
- Too limited (can't handle bulk or HTML)

Civic Line gives you **enterprise email/sms capabilities with CLI simplicity**, perfect for civic projects that need to move fast.

## Security

- Credentials are stored locally using industry-standard encryption
- No data is sent to external servers (except your email provider)
- Database connections are closed immediately after use
- All connections use secure protocols (TLS/SSL)
